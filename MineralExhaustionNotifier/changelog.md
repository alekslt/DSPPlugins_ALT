## MineralExhaustionNotifier v0.5.2

* As some had grown used to the smaller window size with high resolution/pixel densities the scaling code is reworked to base itself on the games UI Layout Reference Height adjustment.
* If you are not happy with the size that the UI Layout Reference Height adjustment gives you there are config options that allow you to override the size. (Larger value = smaller window)
* In game window scale adjustment through - 1 + buttons on the window title bar.
* Fixed sorting for Logistic Stations - Resource. Now sorts on Resource Name, not the internal id. :)

## MineralExhaustionNotifier v0.5.1

* User customizable button placement
* Scaling code to give a consistent UI size independent of resolusion. (Thanks to yushiro for PR)
* Disabled initial pop-up, if alarm situation, for now as I personally didn't find this feature useful. Will bring it back after user customizable triggers are implemented.

## MineralExhaustionNotifier v0.5

* Added information on logistic stations and their items as well
* Filtering options. Filters are logically AND between the filters, and OR for the filter-local. Meaning you can do queries like: Stellar Stations AND Item % below 50%, AND Supply Remote.
* Show information from the data source ( Vein Miners or Logistic Stations) broken down into different groups. Planet style as it was, or Resource based to get a better understanding of everything related to titanium.
* Keybinding is now changed! You need to press an ALT-key before the user bindable key (default I)

## MineralExhaustionNotifier v0.1

First release. Works fine for me, but haven't been tested on other peoples computers yet. RFC.
The plugin will periodically check the miners for an alarm (Low Power, Low Production Yield), and/or if they remaining mineral they can mine is low or none.

If a miner is detected with this condition a first time notification window will pop up, but afterwards only available through the toggle button (M) on lower right,
or by pressing the hot key.

If you have cleared out all faulty miners by default this will allow a popup notification to occur again.
