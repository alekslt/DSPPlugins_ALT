# DSP Plugins by AleksLT

## How to Install :

First Install Bepinex in your game
folder : https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html?tabs=tabid-win

Then Download the latest DLL of the mod : https://github.com/alekslt/DSPPlugins_ALT/releases

And add it to a new subfolder in bepinex plugins folder under the steam game folder : %steamapps\common%\Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\plugins\DSPPlugins_ALT

Launch the game and you should be all set !

After launching one time there will be a config file you can edit in %steamapps\common%\Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\net.toppe.bepinex.dsp.uilayoutheightfix.cfg

## How to use the UiLayoutHeightFix mod ?

The plugin will enforce a UI Layout Height as the game clips the values from the save games to 1080, even if it supports higher resolutions set in runtime.
Please set your preferred value in the config file. (Will be autogenerated after first run. So you need to add plugin. Start game, edit config file and restart game again.)
